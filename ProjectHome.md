## The code repository has been moved to [GitHub](http://github.com/beNative/snippetsource). ##

## The primary download location for releases remains at [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/snippetsource/) ##

# Introduction #

**Snippetsource** is a simple yet powerful repository to store code snippets or any other text content. [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.com/) is used as the database backend which makes fast indexed lookups possible.

It is based on the editor of the [Notepas](http://code.google.com/p/notepas/) project so it will automatically benefit from the incremental changes happening on that project.

## Main features ##

  * Full drag and drop support for both files and tree nodes.
  * Has all the text editing features of [Notepas](http://code.google.com/p/notepas/) as it uses the same editor engine.
  * Fully customizable folder structure with unlimited nesting.
  * Supports easy import of entire folder structures.
  * Powerful search capabilities.
  * Multi-platform support.
